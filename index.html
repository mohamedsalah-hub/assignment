<p>
Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner.
 Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first.
 It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance,
 including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.
